I've always had a pretty sordid history with school. I was placed in remedial
English in 4th grade. I was the only student in the class without a disability.
I stayed there until 7th grade. Later in life I would be suspended for reading
in class. I couldn't tell if my Japanese teacher was more offended by not
paying attention or the length of the Wheel of Time. I didn't graduate high
school on time. I've failed out of College Twice.

So it should come as no surprise when I tell you that writing in a fashion that
people find acceptable, let alone elegant, has been a long time struggle for
me.

Except that as a 7th grader it wasn't a struggle. Because I didn't care. See
this was my problem all along. I didn't care about school and my teachers 
couldn't stop me from being a fuck up without my permission. If you don't
have any expectations, couldn't be bothered by others disappointment, and
are smart enough to just plunk along in school the world is your oyster to
do nothing with.

That is until I played EverQuest for the first time. For those of you that
don't know what EverQuest is it's kind of a pre-cursor to World Of Warcraft.
It's a Massively Multiple Player Only RPG or MMORPG'r for short. The first
night I played EQ I went from level 1-43 (out of 60) in a single sitting. I
started at 7 pm on Thursday and Finished around 9 pm on Friday. It was both
a healthy and unhealthy passion at the same time.

See it was consuming my life but at the same time I was passionate about a
thing. It turns out that having something you're passionate about is better
then having nothing you're passionate about.

After a while of playing by myself I wanted to like, actually talk to people
and shit. See, EverQuest requires you to group and interact with people to
progress after a certain point in the game. And grouping with people before
voice communication through a computer is possible means you have to type
things. And typing things means that you need to sound semi-competent for
people to want to group with you. 

When you type 'ove' when you mean 'of' and 'door' as 'doar' people don't want
to group with you. When you sound like you're 5 years old people don't want to
group with you. Suddenly I found myself with a bunch of motivation to learn
how things are spelled.

And just as a fun side note the first resume I ever wrote was for a high end
raiding guild around the time the Planes of Power expansion came out.
