# Improvisation Workshop (Improve Star Trek)

* The workshop was entirely about accepting failure. The basic idea was that
the most compelling and funny moments come from failure.

* The workshop started off with the "fart warmup." The basic idea was that
everyone runs around yelling "who farted." Every so often your job was to make
fart sounds. The goal is just to get everyone to relax.

* The first group game was the clap game. You start off in a circle. The goal
was to make eye contact and to try to clap at the same time. You pass the clap
down the circle.

* The next iteration allows people to reverse the clap wave by clapping at the
person twice.

* Then we played object passing. The goal is to not change the object but to
just pass it off to the person.

* again with a different object.

* Then you're allowed to change the object.

* Now it's the clap game but you want to try to say the same word. The goal
is to try to get the words of both people to converge to the same word.

* Then we did straight up co-operative story telling.
