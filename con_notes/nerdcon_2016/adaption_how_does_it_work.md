# How Do You Go About Adapting
* Some people can both write novels and screen plays so when they do adaptions
they can do all of the leg work for a section.
* Sometimes you run into people that share passion for your work but have
different skillsets and suddenly you want to collaborate.

# How does collaboration work?
* When other people are involved (Money and Time wise) you're going to have to
compromise on what your vision is. You can't be the stickler you want with
your own work when it's just you.
