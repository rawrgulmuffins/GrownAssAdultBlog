# How To Podcast (James T Green, Max Temkin, Alex Cox)

# What's your Story
* "Steve Jobs announcing that ITunes now hosts podcasts."
* Grew up listening to radio and wanting more colored voices on the airwaves.
* "I remember the original internet that was a bunch of free floating pieces of
technology ... that's now dead ... podcasting excites me so much because anyone
can do it. There's no one topic or idea too out there to not succeed."

# RSS
* Missing the open web. Wishing that RSS still excisted.

# How Can You Get An Audiance
* The topic is almost like choosing how popular your show can potentially be.
* NOTE: look at the show "refresh"
* "Using my shows as an excuse to talk about topics that are interesting and
not being talked about."
* "You can't just talk about 'Star Wars'. You have to talk about Jawas. If you
are capable of it you should talk about a specific jawa."
* "Small Ideas are more important then big ideas."
* "People often look at topics and say 'I feel shut out of this field.' Using
that feeling that people have to make them feel welcome to a topic is a
strength you should look for.

# Gear
* Don't let production quality stop you from producing something
* Logic-Pro, Garage band
* "Making sound good is all about compressing sounds."
* Insuring that music fades in and out. Make sure your show has space.
* When you download logic go to preferences-> advanced tools -> turn them on.

## Affordable Kits
* IPhone or Android as the starter kit to make sure this is worth money to you.
* Be careful about USB. XLR gear has been around for a long time and has many
adapters to most other form factors.
* Zoom H6

# Thoughts On Environment

* Future Proofing is something you should look for in gear for price
reasons.
* Getting close to microphones and having cloth over you can be used as
a portable studio.
* it's hard to talk in a useful way with headphones on.
* Make sure your filters aren't applied to music.

# Noise gate
* Using the default to pull out little audio blips from in the far background.
## The Attack, The Hold, The Release
* The attack is the amount of time before the noise gate initiates.
* default should be around 30 ms for attack.
* The hold is how long you keep the door open.
* A should release causes people to sound like they're choppy when they reduce
volume.
* It's normally better to have an open release.
* You have to tune it to how people talk.
* "If you don't know the theory behind something then brute force is often the
most effective method of production."

# Compressor
* The compressor is an auto volume leveler so you don't need to go in and
manually level everyone.

# Dropping The Voice
* Dropping mid ranges makes voices sound more authoritative.

# Room Tone
* Using Room tone to create a sense of space. It is used to take the listener
to a specific place.
* Don't use room tone to try to fix pops or cracks in people voices. Use the
compressor rather then being lazy. You can use have cheap gear and fix sound
issues in cheap or free editing software.

# Dead Air
* Lots of talk about avoiding dead air.

# Low Pass Filter
* Using a low pass filter to make a track sound like it's more hallow. The
example used made someone's voice sound like it was in a cab.
* Looking for a frequency for when to start taping off the voice.
* You can use this with volumn level to make layered sounds that people 
recognize as background or secondary tracks.

# Questions

* How do you avoid gross mouth noises?

    Filters attached to the microphone (softies and pop screens). You can use
    wire hangers and drain filters.

    You can also make softies using two pairs of pantie-hoes and pointing the
    microphone underneath your mouth.

    This is called Mic technique. 10% microphone and 80% how your talk. Max 
    recommended just getting cheap versions for yourself. Be careful about
    directly talking into a microphone. Becareful about your gain on the mic.

* If you're using a omni-directional mic can you get everyone on their own 
track?

    No, not at this point in time. Micrphones can't distinguish between
    different sound sources. It's only sound originated from the input.

    Multi-ouptut and aggregate devices for multiple tracks from different
    tracks. That way you can make a "fake" mixer. Setting on macbooks
